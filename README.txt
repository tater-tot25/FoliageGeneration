Welcome to Andrew Tate's Foliage Generation!!!
The scripts are designed to be dragged and dropped onto a gameObject
The planePointCalculator script can be adjusted to shape the foliage object, 
the density settings are configured using the place foliage script. The length
of the spawn list must match the length of the probability list, and the probability
list MUST be in order of smallest to largest!!!
